            <p>

                <q>H</q>i, first of all, thanks for visiting in my profile, My name is <b>Anirban Gorain</b>. I lived in "Ukhra" near of <a href="http://www.kniairport.com/" target="_blank">KNI</a> airport "Andal".

            </p>
            
            <p>

                I was completed my class 10 from my home-town school "UKBI", Currently I am a secondary student in <b>Computer science</b> branch in UKBI again. 

            </p>

            <p>

                <br><br>

                <b>Why I took "CS" in my secondary education?</b>

                <br><br>

                I had many options but still was chosen "CS". Actually, when I was approx in class 9/10 my friends have had some 
                knowledge of computers not related to programming like Games, MS office, etc. But I didn't have kinds of knowledge 
                about computers even I didn't know that what is the <b>Shut-down</b>, Over there I was felling some uncomfortable, 
                Then I was joined with a computer coaching center, I was learned some basics. But less than to my friends because 
                they had "Computers" in their house.

                <br><br>

                Then finally after pass out my class 10, I was got a Laptop and Internet connection, Then slowly I knew that how 
                to search on the <b>Google</b>, <b>Youtube</b> like's platforms. Then I told my family and seniors about my 
                interest and they are suggested me to take admission in <b>Vocational "CS" branch</b> because it is available in 
                my home town.

                <br><br>

                I was purchased all the books for this field there are many books has <b>Visual basic (A programing language, My first language also), 
                HTML, VB script, DBMS, and other common subjects</b>, First time was really hard to adopt these subjects because I 
                didn't listen to the name of these subjects. Our institution's mentors made these subjects very easy for us and I was feeling that I am walking in the right direction.

                <br><br>
                After approximately 2 years I am here now. Now I know that what is the MNCs (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Linkedin, Facebook, De shaw, TCS, CISCO, etc), For these companies today our Life is very easy üôè.

                <br><br>
                If I telling my future goals, So I decided that I will do <a href="https://www.sarvgyan.com/courses/bca#:~:text=Bachelor%20in%20Computer%20Application%20(BCA)%20is%20an%20undergraduate,degree%20course%20in%20computer%20applications.&text=The%20duration%20of%20the%20course,C'%20and%20'java'." target="_blank">BCA</a> 
                3 years program, Then I will sit on the <a href="https://www.nimcet.in/">NIMCET Examination</a>, According to may 
                rank I will choose an appropriate Collage for <a href="https://www.collegedekho.com/courses/mca/">MCA</a>, And I will try place at a company,Where I need üèÜ.
